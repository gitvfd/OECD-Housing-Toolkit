Spending	Inclusiveness		Tax support for homeownership tends to support higher-income households, fuels demand and pushes up property prices, especially when supply is rigid, which exacerbates the housing affordability challenge. Eliminating (or reducing) mortgage interest rate deductibility or curtailing capital gains relief on owner-occupied housing alleviates pressure on housing costs. In addition, reducing these tax advantages, which primarily accrue to above-average-income households, can help to make taxation more progressive while freeing up budgetary resources: these can be used to help lower-income families irrespective of tenure. <br/>Higher transaction costs for buying and selling a home, in particular from transaction taxes such as stamp duties and notary fees, are associated with lower residential mobility, especially among younger households, which are more likely to be first-time buyers. Tax reforms shifting housing taxation from non-recurrent (mostly transaction) to recurrent taxes would help reduce barriers to mobility. Further, split-rate taxes, that is, placing higher taxes on developed land than on the structures built, reduce development pressure at the rural-urban fringe and provide further incentive to redevelop urban brownfields and expand housing supply. 
Spending	Efficiency		Fiscal support for the housing of low-income families mainly occurs in the form of housing allowances and the provision of social housing. Many countries have implemented a shift away from social housing toward housing allowances. The collected evidence calls for reversing this trend. Indeed, when running against overly rigid supply, housing allowances tend to be capitalised in rents, with the result that they mainly benefit landlords while being neutral for recipients and even harmful for renters who are not recipients.<br/>The provision of social housing directly benefits families in need if well designed and governed. Stepping up social housing investments increases the housing stock, which reduces the overall pressure on house prices. Importantly, eligibility to social housing should be portable across cities and regions to avoid obstacles to the mobility of low-income workers. A regular reassessment of the eligibility is necessary to guarantee that scarce resources benefit those who need them the most. 
Spending	Sustainability		The provision of green social housing that complies with the highest energy efficiency standards contributes to the transition to a low-carbon economy, both directly and indirectly by exerting peer pressure on the private construction market. Upgrading the existing housing stock, including through the energy-efficient renovation of historic buildings, may require subsidies to internalise the positive externality of improved energy efficiency if the carbon pricing of heating fuels is insufficient. If the upgrading subsidies get capitalised into higher prices, they can be later recuperated through recurring property taxation.<br/>Increasing motor fuel taxes can improve the environmental performance of cities. By encouraging the development of underdeveloped land, split-rate taxes reduce development pressure at the rural-urban fringe and provide further incentive to redevelop urban brownfields to enhance the supply of housing.

Regulation	Inclusiveness		The use of macro-prudential tools can help to prevent the build-up of systemic risks by moderating credit and asset price cycles while ensuring the presence of sufficient buffers in the financial system. A key advantage of macro-prudential regulation is that it can be tailored to risks of specific sectors, such as housing, or loan portfolios, such as mortgages. In contrast to interest rate hikes, macro-prudential tightening need not entail a generalised reduction of economic activity, limiting the potential costs of policy intervention. <br/>Relaxing overly tight rent control increases the attractiveness of residential investments and the appetite for investors to build and sublet. More responsive supply, in turn, has the potential to make housing markets more efficient and affordable in the long term.  Excessive protection of tenants can weigh on residential mobility as renters with uncertain labour market prospects, such as low-wage or non-standard workers, find it difficult to sign a lease. Indeed, facing the risk of little support in case of non-payment, landlords would tend to be more selective in their choice of tenants ultimately harming those that the regulation intended to protect.
Regulation	Efficiency		The use of macro-prudential tools supports macroeconomic stability. However, tightening measures such as loan-to-value caps for mortgage borrowers or increasing capital requirements for issuing banks can penalise young households with limited savings to acquire a dwelling. Where appropriate, this trade-off can be mitigated at least in part by targeting support to first-time homebuyers through tax-favoured savings plans that help them accumulate their upfront payment.<br/>A flexible rent-control system where rents can be set freely for new contracts and renewals but regulated in line with market developments during the duration of the contract provides tenants with reasonable security over tenure and rent levels while ensuring the profitability of residential investments. Restricting vehicle access to city centres can improve the environmental performance of cities but can also have adverse implications for affordability by redirecting housing demand towards supply-constrained city centres.
Regulation	Sustainability		Benchmarking and enforcement of the building envelop energy efficiency standards would improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and allow for a faster transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Retrofitting of the existing housing stock should be enforced and accompanied by means-tested subsidies. <br/>Relaxing building height restrictions can help to curtail urban sprawl, commuting and urban CO2 emissions.
Urban planning	Inclusiveness		Excessively tight building height restrictions can exacerbate the scarcity of housing supply in strongly demanded areas. The governance of land-use planning systems should avoid overlaps between different levels of government and favour planning at the metropolitan level rather than at lower levels of government to prevent political economy frictions to constructions such as not-in-my-backyard type of behaviours.
Urban planning	Efficiency		Government acquisition of land to prevent development attenuates adverse consequences of urbanisation but also limits supply and, therefore, exacerbates affordability concerns. The introduction of green belts benefits incumbent homeowners, both in terms of land values and access to valuable amenities, while excluding would-be tenants and buyers. 
Urban planning	Sustainability		The densification of urban areas reduces commuting and improves the environmental performance of cities. Limiting development in environmentally valuable areas or encouraging developers to transfer their development rights to already developed areas can help to preserve biodiversity in functional urban areas and reconcile urban growth with environmental sustainability.<br/>On the one hand, flexible land-use policies allow builders to swiftly respond to demand shifts thereby improving the matching of local demand and supply. On the other hand, unrestrained construction can have unintended consequences on economic resilience and the environment. The governance framework should, therefore, also allow internalising adverse externalities and accommodate housing demand in a coherent framework at the metropolitan level.
